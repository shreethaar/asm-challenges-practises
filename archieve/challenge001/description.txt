Simple Encryption Algorithm using x86 assembly language

Specifications:
1. The algorithm should take an input string and a key
2. It should encrypt the input string using the key
3. You can choose any simple encryption technique such as Caesar cipher, XOR cipher or a custom algorithm
4. The encrypted string should be printed out as the output

You can break down into smaller steps:
1. Input handling:
Prompt the user to enter a string and a key
2. Encryption algorithm:
Implement the chosen encryption technique to encrypt the input string using the given key
3. Output:
Print the encrypted string
